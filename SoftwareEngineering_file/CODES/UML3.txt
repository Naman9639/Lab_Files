To study UML user case diagram (ucd)

introduction
-Use case diagram are dynamic in nature, dynamic behaviour 
-It consists of internal and external factors for making the interaction
-these internal and external agents are known as actors
-It consists of actors, use cases and relationships

Purpose of use cases
-it's used to gather requirements of a system
-used to get an outside view of a system
-it shows the interaction among the requirements and the actors

How to draw Use case diagram
-We have to first identify the actors actors can be defined as something that interacts with the system
-the actors can be human users some internal applications or may be some external applications

Where to use UCD
-It specify the events of a system and their flows but use case diagram never discibe how they are implemented
-UCD can be an image as a black box where only the input output and the functions of the black box 
-UCD can be in forward engineering process and backwaard engineering process

System boundary
-It defines the limit of a system
-It is represented by rectangular box
-Use case are inside the boundary
-Actors are outside the boundary

Relationships in UCD-
-Multiplicity of associations

-Multiplicity of an actors
(sccreenshots)
NOTE- only binary associations are allowed in actors and use cases

Include
-When a use case is depicted as using the functionality of another use case this relationship between the use cases is named as the include relationship
-The directed arrow having a dotted line 
-The tip of the arrow head points to the child use case and the parent use case is connected at the base of the arrow
-The stereo type "<<include>>" identifies the relationship as the
//make two use cases.

Extend
-Extend relationship between the child case adds to the existing functionality and characteristics of parent use case
-A directed arrow having a dotted line (same as include) 
-The tip of the arrow have points to the parent use case and the child use case is connected at the base of the arrow
